# Medical Chatbot

## Overview

The **Medical Chatbot** is an AI-powered virtual assistant built using **Flask**, **Pinecone**, and **LangChain**. This chatbot answers medical-related queries by leveraging a **Large Language Model (LLM)** and vector databases for accurate responses. The backend is powered by **Pinecone** for vector storage and **LangChain** for the model and retrieval chain, while the frontend provides a simple and interactive user interface for seamless communication.

## Features

- **Real-time interaction**: Instantly responds to medical queries.
- **Backend integration** with **Pinecone** for efficient vector storage and retrieval of medical data.
- **Customizable UI**: Built with modern frontend technologies, including **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.
- **Natural Language Understanding**: Uses a **pre-trained LLaMA-2 model** for understanding and generating medical responses.
- **AJAX-powered** interactions for a smoother user experience.
- **Easy setup** with minimal dependencies.
